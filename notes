react-host

need to setup the webpack manually since we need to use module federation

npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-react babel-loader css-loader style-loader webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin file-loader
need to import react for every pages

understanding babel and webpack is a must.

==================================================

1. Decide which app as the host (container) and the remote
2. In the remote, decide which modules needs to be available to others
3. In the remote, setup module federation plugin to expose those files
4. In the host, decide which file we want to get from the remote
5. In the host, setup module federation to fetch those files
