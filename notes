react-host

need to setup the webpack manually since we need to use module federation

npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-react babel-loader css-loader style-loader webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin file-loader
need to import react for every pages

understanding babel and webpack is a must.

==================================================

1. Decide which app as the host (container) and the remote
2. In the remote, decide which modules needs to be available to others
3. In the remote, setup module federation plugin to expose those files
4. In the host, decide which file we want to get from the remote
5. In the host, setup module federation to fetch those files

=============================

challanges
1. webpack
2. share dependency
3. share css
4. webpack-dev-server running twice
5. challanges in implementing tailwind
6. when a single server down, the whole app is down
7. share authorization
8. must be independent
9. security, will that exposed? should not expose the html, need to check is it development or production
10. react require us to run a single copy (singleton), but what if two different version?
11. How to group what feature on which squad on which app
12. need squad to manage the container



==============================
why tailwind css doesn't work? coz tailwind is a predefined css, so when we load the page, the css is not included.
