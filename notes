react-host

need to setup the webpack manually since we need to use module federation

npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-react babel-loader css-loader style-loader webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin file-loader
need to import react for every pages

understanding babel and webpack is a must.
